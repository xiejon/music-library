# Music Library

An app that allows users to enter and keep track of repertoire. Adapted from the traditional book library project as part of The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript course.

## Objectives 

1. Allow user to click button to add music repertoire. The user will then fill out a form with the title of the piece, composer, key, etc.
2. Display titles in cards on the page. 
3. Display whether title has been played or not. Allow user to click to change the played status. 

## Motivation

- I just learned about object constructors. Here, I experimented using an object constructor to turn user input into an object, before pushing it onto an array. 
- I am an opera singer, and I love the idea of a visual online library containing all of my music in an easy to read format. 

## Challenges 
1. User Experience
    - It is important to me that the app is pleasant to use. From my own experience, I know how simple hover effects and a well-designed UI makes me much more likely to continue using a website or app. However, there were some things I didn't quite know how to implement. For example: jumping placeholders in my form inputs. It took lots of trial and error before I found a working solution.

## Areas for Improvement 

- Allow the user to sign-in and store their library online. Currently, the myLibrary array is not being used.
- Option to search for repertoire by title or composer
- Function to sort library alphabetically

## Key Takeaways 

Object Constructors
- The focus of this project was learning to implement an object constructor to turn user input into an object, before pushing it into an array. 

User Experience
- Through CSS animations such as the jumping placeholders in my form inputs and hover effects, I attempted to create a more pleasing & interactive interface. 

## Areas for Improvement 

- Currently, the myLibrary array is not being used for anything. In the future, I hope to revisit this project to allow the user to sign-in and store their entries online.
